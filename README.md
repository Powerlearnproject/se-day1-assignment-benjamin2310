Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the application of scientific principles through the design and creation of softwares using programming languages. It ensures reliability, scalability, and maintainability, making it crucial in the tech industry for building robust applications. It Has contributed to the tech industry in several way, from automation, CI/CD, Machine Learning and the like aiding in meeting the needs of users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. AI and Automation - Enhanced software development with AI-driven tools and DevOps(Developer + Operations) automation.
2. The use of Agile Manifesto - Software Engineering has shifted development to iterative and flexible methodologies.
3. Structured Programming - Introduced organized coding practices like modularization, making software more maintainable.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle Are;

4. Planning: Define project scope and gathering requirements.
5. Design: Develop system architecture, create design documentation etc.
6. Development: Bringing the design to live through coding, tasks are assigned to developers.
7. Testing: Identify and fix bugs to ensure it meets the requirements specified, quality assurance is needed here. There are several kinds of testing as well and the team gets to decide which one is needed for their software.
8. Deployment: Code is released to production environment and later software is released to users.
9. Maintenance: Stakeholder feedback, discussing of issues/bugs identified, code is enhance(refactoring) and updates etc.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall - it's a sequential, rigid, best for well-defined projects (e.g., healthcare systems) whilst Agile - is iterative, flexible, best for evolving projects (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer - Writes and maintains code especially with some specific functionality.
2. QA Engineer - Tests and ensures software quality.
3. Project Manager - Oversees project scope, timelines, and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide a unified workspace with features like code editing, debugging, and project management, boosting developer productivity. Examples- Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA etc

Version Control System tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and ensures code history is preserved for easy rollback and auditing. Examples - Git, Apache Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Technical Debt - Poorly written code slows future development and the solution to this is regular refactoring and automated testing.
2. Keeping Up with Tech Changes - the rapid evolution of tools and frameworks and the solution to this is continuous learning via courses, blogs, and developer communities.
3. Scope Creep- The uncontrolled feature expansion delays projects and the way to curb this is to give clear requirements, use agile approach, and involve stakeholders.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

4. Unit - Tests individual components.
5. Integration - Tests module interactions.
6. System - Tests the complete system.
7. Acceptance - Validates against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to elicit specific responses from AI models. Think of it as the interface between human intent and machine output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the role of AI in healthcare, focusing on diagnosis and treatment advancements."

The improved prompt is more specific, guiding AI toward relevant details and focuses on a particular topic in an industry.
